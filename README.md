ðŸ’¡ NOTE

This exercise could be done either by declaring an interface or an abstract class. I chose to declare an abstract class for comprehensiveness reasons: the statement says that, in addition to a method for making a sound, "animals has a name". So, I understood "name" as an attribute common to all animals, and interfaces cannot contain attributes.
