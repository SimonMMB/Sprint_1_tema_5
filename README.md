POO 2

=> 21-JAN-25: LEVELS 2 & 3

📄 EXERCISES DESCRIPTION

LEVEL 1
- Exercise 1: We need to create a data type that represents an animal. Animals have a name, but the sound of a dog’s “talk” is not the same as that of a cat’s. Therefore, we need to create other data types that help us program these behaviors. Basically, we want a makeSound() method that displays a different message if it is a dog (for example, “Boop, boop!”) or a cat (for example, “Mine!”).

LEVEL 2
- Exercise 1: Write a program that defines a Shape class with a constructor that takes width and height as parameters. Define two subclasses; Triangle and Rectangle that inherit from Shape and calculate the area of ​​the shape area() respectively.

LEVEL 3
- Exercise 1: Following the previous exercise, imagine how you would expand the structure you have created to represent a Circle and its corresponding area calculation.
